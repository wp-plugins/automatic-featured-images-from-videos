If a YouTube or Vimeo video exists in the first portion of a post, automatically set the post's featured image to that video's thumbnail.

== Description ==

When placing a YouTube or Vimeo video within the first 1000 characters of a post, the thumbnail of that video will automatically be sideloaded and set as the featured image for the post as long as the post does not already have a featured image set.

In addition, after setting the video thumbnail as the featured image, an “is_video” post meta field is updated to allow for the use of conditional statements within your loop.
